            This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. 
            <i>In sous</i> vide cooking, you submerge the food <em>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</em> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. 
            <i>In his book</i>, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.

        <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
